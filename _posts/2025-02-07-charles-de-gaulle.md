as i wait for boarding to commence on my flight to doha, connecting to hanoi, vietnam - i can't help but be amazed by the paris' main airport. as someone who has had the priviledge of being at more than a few airports, i don't think i have ever experienced an airport like this.

its not the amenities, nor the layout that makes this place so special - its just the feeling that you get once you are in it. a mixture of french cultural thought, it is almost as if it was made before the current capitalist idea that plagues so many airports in the world currently... i am looking at you doha, istanbul and melbourne charging 12 euros for a coffee... i mean to be honest the economics of captive audiences makes sense and i understand that, so it boggles me as to why the french had spent so much time and effort making things that aren't making any money so elegant, chaming and quite frankly extravagant. the beautiful couches, seats and chess tables that are more beautiful than airport lounges, and a grand piano displaying herself in the corner of a room that is barely filled. it is almost unaffected by the greedy, fast paced mentality that is so prevalent of the 21st century.

thats the thing that gets me, as while i am so grateful that a place like this exists, it also stands for a time, a mentality that no longer exists - maybe for a good reason. charles de gaulle airport is very much indicative of the city of paris. a city so beautiful one cannot even comprehend. when i look at the city, i can only think of the wealth, power and influence that this nation once had. and now certainly it is not a poor city/nation by any means, but just like their neighbour from across the channel, truly the sun has set on this great empire. maybe it is a set narrative that i am biased to in my brain, being from a former french colony. when i look at charles de gaulle, it is not a new airport - americans are constantly complaining about its layout and how ancient it is and the rigamarole process it is to get from one side of the airport to another, but for me it is an icon of a time vorbei - just like the concorde. the last hurrah of the empires of yesteryear gone out not with an explosion but with a quiet simmer into the night.
